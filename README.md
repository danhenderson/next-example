# Next Example

### Issues

- Awkward to configure base path to deploy to GH pages i.e. set asset prefix in `next.config.js`, wrap links in component that adds prefix, all images need to add prefix etc.
- `withRouter` just didn't work for me for some reason, but using `useRouter` hook worked correctly
